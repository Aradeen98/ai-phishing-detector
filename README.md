# AI-Powered Phishing Email Detector 🎯  

This project explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** can detect phishing emails based on their content and metadata. It aims to contribute to research in **cybersecurity** and **machine learning for threat detection**.  

---

## 🔍 Overview  

Phishing remains one of the most common cyber threats, where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information. This project uses a **machine learning model** trained on real and simulated phishing datasets to automatically classify whether an email is *legitimate* or *phishing*.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🧩 Model Workflow  

1. **Dataset preprocessing** — clean and tokenize text from email subjects and bodies.  
2. **Feature extraction** — convert words into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.  
3. **Model training** — train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes.  
4. **Evaluation** — compare accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
5. **Deployment (optional)** — create a simple Streamlit or Flask app to test new emails.
