# 🧠 AI-Phishing-Detector  
*A Machine Learning Project to Detect Phishing Emails Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)*  

---

## 📘 Abstract  
Phishing attacks continue to be one of the most prevalent cybersecurity threats worldwide.  
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to automatically detect phishing emails using natural language processing (NLP).  
By analyzing text patterns in emails, the model classifies messages as either *phishing* or *legitimate* with the goal of enhancing email security.

---

## 🧪 Methodology  
The project leverages the following workflow:  
1. **Data Collection:** Synthetic and sample email texts labeled as phishing (1) or legitimate (0).  
2. **Preprocessing:** Text tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization using `TF-IDF`.  
3. **Model Selection:** Logistic Regression, chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.  
4. **Evaluation:** Accuracy metric used to assess classification performance on test data.  

Key libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `TfidfVectorizer`.

## 📊 Results  
The model achieved **90–95% accuracy** on sample email datasets.  
Although trained on a small sample, this framework can scale to real-world datasets to support  
AI-based phishing detection in email systems.

---

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Expand dataset with real-world email corpora.  
- Integrate deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs or Transformers).  
- Deploy as a browser extension or cloud-based API for real-time phishing detection.
